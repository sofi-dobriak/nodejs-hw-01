The first homework on the Node.js block

Practice reading and editing a file.

Wrote functionality for

- generating all contacts
- getting all contacts from a file
- adding one contact to a file
- getting the number of contacts
- deleting all contacts
- delete the last contact, if any

Additionally, I rewrote the work from js to ts

To generate contacts, I used the Faker library
